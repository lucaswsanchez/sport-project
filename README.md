## Description
This is a project under development, where I'm creating a football blog with React and Firebase. The blog provides a platform for football fans to explore and discuss about the most important leagues in the world. The project uses Firebase as a backend to get information about teams and leagues. In addition, it uses Firebase authentication which allows users to log in with their email and leave comments on the different sections of the blog.

## Demo
You can see a live demo of the project [here](https://sport-project.netlify.app/).
